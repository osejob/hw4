<!-- // I struggled to put this together, and couldn't get the APIs to work unfortunately. I definitely underestimated
// this assignment and didn't leave myself with enough time. I was able to do the 3-column newspaper layout and
// was also able to get the ads to work. I feel like some of the javascript code was on the right track but
// clearly not where it needed to be.

// Would really appreciate some feedback and hopefully a passing grade :) -->
